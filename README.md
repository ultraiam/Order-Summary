## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

While I was making this component, I didn't want to use bootstrap sense I was told that frameworks change overtime but html/css would last. So that's essentially what
I did. It took me longer than I'd like to take on these types of components but that just proves I'm still a novice. I learned how to use flex, articles, and 
the @import and @media functions to control the components properties. 


### Continued development

I'm going to continue going through all of the free components and work on becoming more effecient at coding them. This is really fun and I hope I can get a high
paying developer position as I get better over time.
